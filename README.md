# Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project was made as part of the freeCodeCamp *"Data Analysis with Python"* course and was made using their Gitpod starter code. The instructions for this project can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer).

The aim of the project is to visualize the time series datset with a line plot, bar chart and box plots using the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn packages. The charts created should match the images in the example folder.
